# Status of Permission Recipience. Is Perkedel accepting exclusive permission grant right now? 
## Active

~~Perkedel Technologies and affiliates is not accepting permission right now. To be featured in this mod, you must make sure your license is permissive, **without requiring to request permission from authors related**. Additionally, you also have to make sure that commercial use (such as deployment in monetized environments like coin operated arcade machines, except paywalled resales obviously) are allowed as well, although not mandatory, but may increase the chance.~~

You will get the following permission request that looks like this, from any Perkedel members such as JOELwindows7 (Joel Robert Justiawan)

```
# Hey can I use this one up here?
pls?
```

or anything that looks like asking for permission.

To accept the following request, simply reply that message with sentence that node towards *agreement* such as `Yes`, `Yes, you may`, `Go ahead`, etc. etc. Remember, **there will be no undo once we have captured your response**, therefore please consider carefully.

To reject the following request, please reply with the following template bellow:
```

State that I have been doing this in well condition and under my conciousness, without any endorsement, without any force, and without any interference from any party whatsoever.

I also understand the consequences that will be received from the requester in exchange as follows:
