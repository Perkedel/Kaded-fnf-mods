## Rendering & Hosting
The best method is to render as `HTML5`. Note however, according to the source code `.hx`, for `HTML5` render, the song file **will use `MP3`** format instead of typical `OGG` due to perhaps incompatibility with the web standard or performance. You will need to use heuristic or any how to convert all your song assets into `MP3` (for which one that haven't already), **and make sure that the bitrate is set to exactly `160 Kbps`. Can be less, but no more.** must be `<=160 kbps`!!! This ensure the browser tab doesn't burden the lag, buffering, and quota drain.
