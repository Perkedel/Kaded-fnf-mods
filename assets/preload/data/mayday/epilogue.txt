:dad: Okay, so we're done! Any questions?
:gf: If I may know, do you feel that we've been all low on Air?
:dad: Absolutely not. This Floating stone has been equipped with an atmosphere.
:dad: We've pressured it at about average latitude level on earth and some spaceships when with air in it.
:dad: There is no solid barrier though, Therefore it is advisable to not have
:dad: high amount of motions in this stone. In fact the sphere only has radius about 500 Metres.
:gf: When you'll um.. We, finish the tour?
:dad: The time when we finish the tour is not yet defined, but we've had the plan for it.
:gf: Oh, okay.
:dad: Development for the "Milked version" for this one pressumably takes around 1 to 3 years..
:dad: Ah peck! insult again?? "Milked"??? Pardon me, We're having `period` recently.. I mean.. Yeah punneh
:gf: lol!
:dad: Yeah so uh, in maybe 3 years. or less, or more. Whew, I think we're gonna have a long day,
:dad: until just so many left, few left, to eventually so lonely
:dad: we deserve to become
:dad: `Last Funkin Moments`, so to speak.
:gf: Okay, thank you for your information!
:dad: You're welcome. And we'll see you again, maybe next month or so.
:dad: We'll take it from here.
