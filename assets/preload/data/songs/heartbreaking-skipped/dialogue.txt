:dad: we skipped it.
:dad: We did not expect to encounter such a tremendous & escalating efforts required
:dad: specifically for the flow of the tempos.
:dad: You see, this song was played by hand, in a style of manually played pianism, type mellow.
:dad: With this style, comes varying numbers of tempo during the song play.
:dad: This should not be an issue to replicate its tempo flow for this song chart, however..
:dad: for the case of this song, we are failed to find tempo flow informations.
:dad: It is the MIDI file, the accurate MIDI file we needed.
:dad: Nope. we could not find any single MIDI file or sheet music that got its proper flow of

:dad: So until one accurate MIDI file or Sheet music available publicly, with heavy heart
:dad: we skipped it.
