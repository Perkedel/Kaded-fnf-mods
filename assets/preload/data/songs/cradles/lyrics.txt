(BRIDGE) I wanna taste your content:: 
hold your breath and feel the tension::  
devils hide behind redemption:: 
honesty is one-way gate to hell:: 
I wanna taste consumption:: 
breathe faster to waste oxygen:: 
hear the children sing aloud:: 
it's music 'till the wick burns out::HUSH

(OUTRO) Just wanna be:: 
care free lately,::yeah 
just kicking up daisies::Got 
one too many quarters in my pockets:: 
count 'em like the four leaf clovers in my locket:: 
Untied laces,::yeah 
just tripping on daydreams::Got
dirty little lullabies playing on repeat:: 
might as well just rot around::the nursery and count sheep (END)
