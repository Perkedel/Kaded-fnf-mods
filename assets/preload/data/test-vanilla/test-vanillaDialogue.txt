:dad:The final song right here will be very hard no matter what difficulty you've chosen.
:bf:Whoah!? Okay.
:gf:Please don't be too hard for us, therefore.
:dad:No, it is not impossible though. I'm here providing just the way it is. It wasn't my intention to compete.
:bf:Okay, what is this song about?
:dad:during the work for the 0.2.8 update, as well as the most *exciting update*, 
:dad:Mth (if not wrong) in his involvement wanted to improve the rhythming system.
:dad:With it, he needs to test the capability of the brand new rhythming system, so this is what he came with.
:dad:To test voice syncs and multi press capability, while minimizing the infuriating input drops on the previous system.
:dad:Mth also built an alternative charting way that harnesses the power of FLStudio. So called, SNIFF, the SiIva Note Importer.
:dad:With this way, you just use the provided FLStudio template to build rhythm charts fast and efficient compared with internal charter.
:dad:Because FLStudio is DAW and obviously is so accurate, anyone can join the easy while making the most accurate chart.
:bf:Wow! that's amazing!!
:dad:Indeed. Now, bear with me. This should not be too impossible to handle, you can do this. ready?
:bf:Yeah!
:dad:Alright, let's begin! Test by Kawai Sprite
