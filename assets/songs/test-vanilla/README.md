# Alert!
The Voices.ogg that shipped from Vanilla & any FNF mods like Kade Engine, FNFM+, FPS+, Mic'd Up, etc. etc. are empty! they're just silence.

Confirmed the silence on [Kade Engine](https://github.com/KadeDev/Kade-Engine/blob/stable/assets/songs/test/Voices.ogg ) & [Vanilla](https://github.com/ninjamuffin99/Funkin/blob/master/assets/songs/test/Voices.ogg )

# Here, we've provided the actual voice. Please use this voice file here.
