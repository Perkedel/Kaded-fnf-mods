# Week Minus One
What is this? some sort of reject? hidden level? or what?
## What is Week -1
This is the place where you put your song that either:
- wasn't supposed to be a week part
- don't know where week to put this one at
- quarantined song chart. to be decided whether should this be gone, or resolved.
- Experiments & Warm-ups. Excercise your song chart making & or music composing, or even choosing one.

## Who is Week -1 for
Nobody. it was our scrapbook. to be only Freeplay songs.

## Why is Week -1 here?
Flaws. design flaw in this Friday Night Funkin. according to song loading part everywhere (Story Mode, Freeplay, even PlayState.hx), you need to have that exact week folder number. you put 12, you must have `week12` in `assets` folder at all time. when you attempted to load without that folder being there, it will crash 404 not found. So that's my workaround.

Yeah shouldn't have done that design, but eh whatever. you wanted it fast right? wait. Week was not here until after post Ludum Dare I guess, so **you done faulty, ninja_muffin99**! Sorry. I just, don't know why. Like, if there is no longer deadline, why didn't you thought longer term? why not have scanning system? or since this Haxe has whole lot of limitation, at least you could've given the configuration file for it.
## Where will Week -1 be useful?
in any situation. especially if you need to focus on charting song, and needs to be tested real quick before the time comes.

## When Week -1 cease addition?
It won't, until the time comes.

## How to use Week -1?
Simple. have a song. can yoink if you want, and put in the list at `freeplaySongList.txt`. and in the week number, you put `-1`. e.g., `Ognetem:hookx:-1` like that. **Minus one.**

and you are free to put song exclusive to this library `week-1` but I do not recommend that, because our asseting system will be designed in the non-specific folders, outside those `weekNNN`s folders and have our configurable procedural loadings in each of those file types. Unless if you are yoinking from other mods and be ready to program for that yoink, i.e. too lazy I just wanna play it.

# enjoy
have fun with this. Noone can see you, hopefully.

and remember. If you happen to place a somebody we've known somewhere and wanted to remove it,

**keep the addition history**. DO not turn back in time just to force push `Purgeful Nexus Event` to make it like she never been existed ever. Violation, you'll pay the consequences. You don't know what it is? C'mon, it's a common language amongst Gitters, you'll know that later. Basically don't force destroy the commit of when she was added, that's all. Yeah, it is usually for in case you've leaked a private keys & passwords, and that's the only legal & proper reason doing that.

Right, enjoy! have a nice day!
