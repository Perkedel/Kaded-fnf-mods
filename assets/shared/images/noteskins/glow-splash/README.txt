IMPORTANT:
This is a imitation of the Week 7 effect when you hit a sick, it isn't very exact
like the original week 7 because it has more frames, if you want the real splash
effect you'll have to code it in like PsychEngine, please wait for week 7 source
code so it can be added.

Also it doesn't have a pixel variation because there's no space to draw the effect.
