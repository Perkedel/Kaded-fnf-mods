# More Information on Contributing to Kade Engine

## Branches
`stable` is the repository's main branch, so people can clone a stable Kade Engine to work on their mods. However, this means that Pull Requests will default to merge into
`stable` instead of `master`.

### If your pull request changes the engine, it merges into MASTER.
### If your pull request changes the website, it merges into STABLE.

This really took this long to document. Why?

Okay, uh, if you want to contribute here, make sure your part of contribution is Free as in Freedom (yes, software coding must be GNU GPL v3 or whatever compatible, and asset is CC4.0-BY-SA or whatever that allows derivative), not just being Open Source, and uh go to `sammer-woost` branch yess. Be careful about assets that are royaltiful or No Commercial, as those asset may or will be censored in Arcard machine manufacturing.
