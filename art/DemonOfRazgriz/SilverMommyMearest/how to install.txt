Slap the 'momCar.png' and 'momCar.xml' into whatever appropriate folders to replace Mom.
For the icons, open up the 'Icons.png', then copy paste them onto Mommy Mearests icons in 'iconGrid.png', If you're using an 
engine with Icons separated into individual files, copy the icons image and paste it over the appropriate files.

if you're on Psyche Engine, put the file in 'PyscheEngineStuff' into the 'characters' folder in the assets folder.

Not every engine and modpack is the same and these steps aren't universal, but I'm sure you can figure it out reader.
