Most of the work I've done doing skin mods has been done in Vanilla, and Some Kade Engine mods,
I've not extensibly tested it on things running psyche engine because it's confusing.
I've included this folder in case it might be needed for something but I doubt it, use the JSONs
in here at your own discretion yadda yadda.
