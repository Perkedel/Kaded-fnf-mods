todo: write criticisms & appreciations

# Critics
## Constructive

### Unprocedural asset loadings of Songs, Stages, bf, gf, player2, etc. etc.
hard coded stuff going on!!!

that will cause mods mostly asset replacement if don't want compile

right, the fact that this game was started as a jam, Ludum Dare. Yes. with Jam, new idea comes up and who know that would worth further development post jam. However, with requirement to think fast, everything in the end will be rushed (because of course it has to be at least playable to some extent at the end of the jam). the mechanism will lack useful features that is very essential to people out there.

### Apache License
don't let them fork into proprietary! protect the freedom!! use GNU GPL v3 instead

edit: now they change license to custom made. explicitly says that you must open source your mods. Although so, he has no specific which part that should be. You see, that in a game, there is Code and Assets. We already able to assume that Code is obviously must be open source. but how about the assets? We're afraid that they decided to close source the assets but the code.

edit 2: they go back. idk anymore, Our decision will always solid, that we'll make sure every single edit right past, present, and future to be Open Source, Gratis, Full version, and with credit as all possible pls tell which one we forgot.

## Destructive

### FULL ASS GAME that is not $0?! wtf?
[kickstarter link pls](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/funkin/friday-night-funkin-the-full-ass-game)

but instead he said that the eventual rollout from the Full ass to the free version?! idk...

hmph we are afraid for the worst. what if week7 came only to the full version? well I hope that's timed again, so eventually rolls out to free version.

todo: why though wtf you betrayed us?

edit: Week 7 Asset embargo finished. allowed to use finally yey!

### It always bring drama
Well let's be honest. Popular game with huge communities already, always invites everyone unfiltered from various background. Which all means that it also includes those bad guys. There are lots of *impostors among us* awaiting to be exposed, to *'death ðŸ’€'* quote on quote. Worse, those could also include whose we've seen being very awesome at making things, and then yeah turns out, peck ðŸ’€.

I'm very afraid now. Who's gonna be thrown off the ship again now ðŸ’€? This pushes me back to corner.

### There are 1 Protoglin Amexamlef
Mods that down due to dramas & harrasment: Mid Fight Madness

Okay, hear me out. this one MFM is nasty. PLS_SAUCE_TWITTER_POST. They pranked us about comeback. They made teaser but gave surprise sike that they still not coming back. During the time like this, you messed our emotion. That's not polite, and we are not treating joking as joking. This is an insult! to all of us. We're not cool about this ðŸ’€.

### Kamatussaisms
Who should I blame, is it the content creator who did bridged the appeals towards kids, or you?, hence nudity would be banned outright on most centralized mod hosting places.

Just so you know, Ninjamuffin had a previous projects you know. and surprise surprise, one of them are plain lewdness. Heck, I even bought that one right at the center just to experience one out, AND LEARN from its source code we could find (I already mentioned this on very bottom). So isn't this an irony? the man of a culture, had this game's modding community being kamatussa, while I believe it wasn't him explicitly ban any 69420 stuffs.

call me creeps, but fighting against lewdness itself is already a drama, you sacred-ass people. You had one feature, and you're denying it. Unless you are a kamatussa being, you don't resist it, you just denied it. helep.

wait, people far there, what are you doing? Ahem sorry, um, wait until you're age first, I'm talking to those matured right here who denied it. Hey, I got ticket to wonderlands here, wanna have some? here, it's free. Now go! it's far there, just go straight to the castle.

okay, anyway where were we? oh yess here. Basically it.

Disclaimer: Due to publicity policy, 69420 stuffs are only allowed through separate mods, cannot be on canon general repositories, this mod must be free from affromentioned 69420 contents. unless, if it is intentionally 69420 mirrors, 69420 parts may be included as a separate package depending to here.  
Now I assume these distro doesn't want 18+ things, so let's play safe. Unless there is PPA or AUR or whatever mirror that intentionally adds these 69420, let's go find ways to get them all in, idk. 

### Haxe Compatibility Calamities
So, you think that Haxe is awesome right? NO IT'S NOT!!! IT'S PECKING ABOMINATION!!! Many of the libraries used here are **not cross platform!!!**

What are those? Those who uses binary library files! Say.. Lua, Discord Rich Presence, VLC, everything C++ compiled binary so dll file whatever. Having the libraries compiled for the platform does not mean it works on others, you gotta compile it for that too, every single of them. WOrse, **it is haard!** you gotta make configuration for each platform & architecture first which things needed to make compile works, and shipable. I failed many times!!! I am glad there are people who made the ports though, but look at other ones that don't have the same privilege of maintains, when I can't!

So you see, this is why FNF & many executable mods not just mine is only available for certain platforms, not all unfortunately. **I WISH THERE IS A WAY TO LET THE NATIVE LIBRARY CROSSPLATFORMLY IN HAXE-NATIVE-DLL-NDLL FORMAT SO JUST COMPILE ONCE FOR ALL!!!** Look at Godot, they have Godot GDExtension, the Native... nvm that's also separate platform (or is it?), but I mean basically, **1 DLL FOR ALL!!!!!** WHY NOBODY HAD THIS?!

Man, At least Godot is better than you. idk man.

## Safe
### Haxe
I am not used to Haxe but I am still learning. You know, I can self-taught any programming language when opportunity like this needs it. I was programming games with Godot. and yeah it's similar a bit.
